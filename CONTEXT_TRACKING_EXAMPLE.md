# Context Tracking System - How It Solves Your Problem

## The Problem You Described

> "if someone says create new class than the agent say i need to lmow thje name or anythimg lile that or even other prompts and when i give it the name ti does not understnaf tje context of the old message what i want is not just for course creation for everything as long as we are doing one action and it is not completed the ai should just stuck there and if someone satys something out of context just tell them dont u wanna create the course first?"

## The Solution: Smart Context Tracking

The new system now maintains context throughout an entire action until it's completed. Here's how it works:

### 🎯 **Scenario 1: Course Creation with Context**

**User:** "create new class"
**AI:** "I need a name for the course. Please provide one."
*[AI starts tracking CREATE_COURSE action, waiting for 'name' parameter]*

**User:** "Advanced Physics"
**AI:** *[Recognizes this as the course name, completes the action]*
"🎉 Course 'Advanced Physics' created successfully!"

### 🚫 **Scenario 2: Preventing Context Switching**

**User:** "create new class"
**AI:** "I need a name for the course. Please provide one."
*[AI is tracking CREATE_COURSE action]*

**User:** "show my meetings"
**AI:** "🔄 I'm still working on something else!

I'm still waiting for the course name to create your course. What would you like to call it?

💡 Would you like to continue with that first?

If you want to start something new, please say 'cancel' or 'stop' to clear the current task."

### ✅ **Scenario 3: Completing Actions Naturally**

**User:** "create assignment"
**AI:** "I need to know which course you want to create an assignment for. Please provide a course name."
*[AI starts tracking CREATE_ASSIGNMENT action, needs 'courseName' and 'title']*

**User:** "in Physics 101"
**AI:** "I'm still waiting for the assignment title. What would you like to call this assignment?"
*[AI updates context with courseName, still needs 'title']*

**User:** "Midterm Exam"
**AI:** *[Recognizes title, action is complete, executes it]*
"🎉 Assignment 'Midterm Exam' created successfully in Physics 101!"

## 🔧 **How It Works Technically**

### 1. **Action Tracking**
- When an action starts but is missing parameters, the system starts tracking it
- All required parameters are stored and monitored
- The conversation context maintains the ongoing action state

### 2. **Parameter Collection**
- The AI intelligently extracts parameters from user messages
- It understands natural language responses (not just structured commands)
- Parameters are collected incrementally until the action is complete

### 3. **Context Enforcement**
- Users cannot start new actions while one is in progress
- The AI reminds them about the ongoing task
- Users can cancel actions with commands like "cancel", "stop", "never mind"

### 4. **Smart Parameter Recognition**
- **Course names:** "Advanced Physics", "Physics 101", "Math 201"
- **Assignment titles:** "Midterm Exam", "Homework 1", "Final Project"
- **Meeting details:** "tomorrow at 3pm", "next Friday", "john@email.com"

## 📋 **Supported Actions with Context Tracking**

| Action | Required Parameters | Example Flow |
|--------|-------------------|--------------|
| **CREATE_COURSE** | `name` | "create class" → "Advanced Physics" → ✅ Complete |
| **CREATE_ASSIGNMENT** | `title`, `courseName` | "create assignment" → "in Physics 101" → "Midterm Exam" → ✅ Complete |
| **CREATE_ANNOUNCEMENT** | `announcementText`, `courseName` | "create announcement" → "Welcome to class" → "in Physics 101" → ✅ Complete |
| **CREATE_MEETING** | `title`, `attendees`, `dateExpr`, `timeExpr` | "create meeting" → "Team Sync" → "with john@email.com" → "tomorrow at 3pm" → ✅ Complete |
| **INVITE_STUDENTS** | `courseName`, `studentEmails` | "invite students" → "to Physics 101" → "john@email.com, jane@email.com" → ✅ Complete |

## 🎮 **User Commands for Context Management**

### **Cancel Current Action:**
- "cancel"
- "stop"
- "never mind"
- "forget it"
- "that's all"
- "done"
- "quit"
- "exit"
- "abort"

### **Continue with Current Action:**
- Just provide the missing information naturally
- "Advanced Physics" (when waiting for course name)
- "tomorrow at 3pm" (when waiting for meeting time)
- "john@email.com" (when waiting for attendee emails)

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **No More Lost Context:** The AI remembers what you were doing
2. **Natural Conversations:** You can provide information in any order
3. **Prevents Confusion:** Can't accidentally start new tasks
4. **Easy Cancellation:** Simple commands to stop what you're doing
5. **Smart Parameter Extraction:** Understands natural language responses
6. **Consistent Experience:** Works the same way for all actions

## 🔍 **Example Conversation Flow**

```
User: "create new class"
AI: "I need a name for the course. Please provide one."
[AI tracks: CREATE_COURSE action, waiting for 'name']

User: "Advanced Physics"
AI: "🎉 Course 'Advanced Physics' created successfully!"
[AI completes action, clears context]

User: "create assignment"
AI: "I need to know which course you want to create an assignment for. Please provide a course name."
[AI tracks: CREATE_ASSIGNMENT action, needs 'courseName' and 'title']

User: "in Advanced Physics"
AI: "I'm still waiting for the assignment title. What would you like to call this assignment?"
[AI updates: courseName collected, still needs 'title']

User: "Midterm Exam"
AI: "🎉 Assignment 'Midterm Exam' created successfully in Advanced Physics!"
[AI completes action, clears context]
```

This system ensures that once you start an action, the AI stays focused on completing it until you're done or explicitly cancel it!
