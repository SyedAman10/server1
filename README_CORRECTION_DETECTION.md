# 🎯 AI-Powered Correction Detection - Complete Implementation

## 📋 What Was Implemented

I've implemented a **fully AI-powered correction detection system** that uses Google Gemini to understand when users correct their previous requests. This system solves your exact use case:

### Your Original Problem:
```
User: "invite student john@gmail.com to class teaching 1"
System: "I couldn't find any courses matching 'teaching 1'."
User: "oh sorry invite rimalabbas2000@gmail.com and the class would be ai support2"
System: "I found multiple courses matching..."
```

### Now It Works Like This:
```
User: "invite student john@gmail.com to class teaching 1"
System: "I couldn't find any courses matching 'teaching 1'."
User: "oh sorry invite rimalabbas2000@gmail.com and the class would be ai support2"
System: ✅ Detects correction automatically
        ✅ Understands BOTH email and class changed
        ✅ Extracts: rimalabbas2000@gmail.com + ai support2
        ✅ Proceeds with corrected information
Result: "Searching for course 'ai support2'..." (with correct email)
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Modified File: `services/ai/intentDetection.js`

#### Added New Function: `detectCorrection()`
- **Lines 1192-1284**: AI-powered correction detection
- **Features**:
  - Checks for correction indicators (sorry, actually, etc.)
  - Analyzes conversation history
  - Uses Gemini AI to identify corrections
  - Extracts both original and corrected parameters

#### Enhanced Function: `detectIntent()`
- **Lines 1292-1321**: Added correction detection as first step
- **Features**:
  - Calls `detectCorrection()` before normal intent detection
  - Preserves original intent with corrected parameters
  - Sets high confidence (0.95) for corrections
  - Includes correction explanation

#### Enhanced Gemini Prompt
- **Lines 1397-1413**: Added correction detection guidance
- **Features**:
  - Explicit instructions for handling corrections

## 🚀 How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is set in your environment
2. Server should be running
3. Valid JWT token for authentication

### Using in Your Application

**The correction detection is automatic!** Just use the API normally:

```javascript
// First message
POST /api/ai-agent/message
{
  "message": "invite john@gmail.com to class teaching 1",
  "conversationId": "user-123"
}

// Correction message (same conversation ID!)
POST /api/ai-agent/message
{
  "message": "oh sorry invite rimal@gmail.com and class is ai support2",
  "conversationId": "user-123"
}
```

The system will automatically:
1. ✅ Detect the correction
2. ✅ Extract both corrected parameters
3. ✅ Apply them to the action
4. ✅ Continue with the task

### Testing

#### Run Automated Tests:
```bash
# Set up your test token in .env
echo "TEST_TOKEN=your_jwt_token_here" >> .env

# Run the test script
node test-correction-detection.js
```

#### Manual Testing with cURL:
```bash
# Store your token
TOKEN="your_jwt_token_here"

# First request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-agent/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "invite student john@gmail.com to class teaching 1",
    "conversationId": "test-123"
  }'

# Correction request
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-agent/message \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "oh sorry invite rimalabbas2000@gmail.com and the class would be ai support2",
    "conversationId": "test-123"
  }'
```

## 📊 Supported Correction Patterns

The AI recognizes these natural correction phrases:

✅ **Explicit Corrections:**
- "sorry" / "oh sorry"
- "actually" / "no actually"
- "i meant" / "I meant to say"
- "correction"
- "no wait"
- "oops"
- "my bad"
- "mistake"
- "change that to"
- "it should be"
- "instead"

✅ **Implicit Corrections:**
- The enhanced Gemini prompt can also detect corrections even without explicit keywords when combined with conversation history

## 🎯 Features

### ✅ AI-Powered (Not Hardcoded)
- Uses Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for intelligent detection
- No rigid regex patterns
- Adapts to natural language variations

### ✅ Context-Aware
- Analyzes conversation history
- Understands what was said previously
- Identifies what needs to be corrected

### ✅ Multi-Parameter Correction
- Can correct email AND class name simultaneously
- Supports partial corrections (only email or only class)
- Preserves unchanged parameters

### ✅ High Confidence
- Returns 0.95 confidence for detected corrections
- Includes explanation of what was corrected
- Flags response with `isCorrection: true`

### ✅ User-Friendly
- Natural language corrections
- No need to restart conversations
- Works with various phrasing styles

## 📈 Response Format

### When Correction is Detected:

```json
{
  "conversationId": "user-123",
  "message": "Searching for course 'ai support2'...",
  "intent": {
    "intent": "INVITE_STUDENTS",
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "parameters": {
      "studentEmails": ["rimal@gmail.com"],
      "courseName": "ai support2"
    },
    "isCorrection": true,
    "correctionExplanation": "User corrected both the student email and the course name"
  }
}
```

### When No Correction:

```json
{
  "conversationId": "user-123",
  "message": "Searching for course 'math 101'...",
  "intent": {
    "intent": "INVITE_STUDENTS",
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "parameters": {
      "studentEmails": ["john@email.com"],
      "courseName": "math 101"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

Check your console for these logs:

```
🔍 DEBUG: detectCorrection called
🔍 DEBUG: Correction detected: { isCorrection: true, ... }
🔍 DEBUG: User is making a correction, applying corrected parameters
🔍 DEBUG: Extracted course name from correction pattern: ai support2
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Corrections not being detected

**Symptoms:**
- User says "sorry" but system treats it as new request
- Parameters don't get updated

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Check that `conversationId` is being passed consistently
2. ✅ Verify conversation history exists
3. ✅ Ensure Gemini API key is valid
4. ✅ Check for correction indicators in message

#### Issue: Wrong parameters extracted

**Symptoms:**
- Email or class name is incorrect
- Only one parameter extracted when both changed

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Check Gemini API response in logs
2. ✅ Verify message contains both email and class name
3. ✅ Ensure conversation history has previous attempt

#### Issue: High API latency

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times (>5 seconds)

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ This is normal - Gemini API call takes ~1-2 seconds
2. ✅ Consider caching for frequently accessed data
3. ✅ Optimize conversation history (currently uses last 5 messages)
